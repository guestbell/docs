Check-In Modal will appear and you can start filling in the details. In order to invite guests, we'll need their email or phone number (refer to next section if you don't have access to email or phone number). GuestBell will send them automated email/text message invitation on the day of the Check-In.

## Self Check-In

You can allow your guest to Check-In on their own, without having access to email/text message invitation. Navigate to **Property -> Edit Property** and go to section **Self Check-In**
GuestBell provides 3 Options of Self Check-In Authorization. Please keep in mind that Self Check-In is Disabled by default.

- **Advanced Authorization** - you still have to create check-in and provide guest's name. You don't have to provide email/phone number. Guests will have to identify themselves by given Requirements in order to check-in.
- **Basic Authorization** - you need to create check-in but don't have to provide any details about guest. The system will automatically create new guest after guest make self check-in. Guest will be authorize to check-in after verifying given Requirements.
- **No Authorization** - anybody can check-in into any room for arbitrary dates. No Requirements needed. If there is no check-in in the system, it will be created automatically, if there is a check-in in the system, it will be used. You don't have to create anything in your system.
