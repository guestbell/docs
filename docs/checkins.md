## Self Check-In
You can allow your guest to Check-In on their own, without having access to email/text message invitation. Navigate to **Property -> Edit Property** and go to section **Self Check-In**
GuestBell provides 3 Options of Self Check-In Authorization. Please do keep in mind Self Check-In is Disabled by default. 

- **Advanced Authorization** - you still have to create check-in and provide guest's name. You don't have to provide email/phone number. Guests will have to identify themselves by given Requirements in order to check-in.
- **Basic Authorization** - you need to create check-in but don't have to provide any details about guest. The system will automatically create new guest after guest make self check-in. Guest will be authorize to check-in after verifying given Requirements.
- **No Authorization** - anybody can check-in into any room for arbitrary dates. No Requirements needed. If there is no check-in in the system, it will be created automatically, if there is a check-in in the system, it will be used. You don't have to create anything in your system.
