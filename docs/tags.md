# Tags

GuestBell lets you create tags for your services, rooms, images, opening hours, permission groups and employees. Tags are very helpful tools which allows you to categorize items into groups. Finding specific items will become breeze with tags. For example you can use tags like king bed, ocean view, bathtub, balcony, non-smoking for chosen rooms.  

Navigate to **Property -> Tags** in Side Bar Menu to see all of your tags.

?> **Tip** Tags are not shared between different sections. You can create same word for two different sections. For example tag **drinks** can be used for service and also image. 

You can create or edit tags in sections where tags are used. For example navigate to **Property -> Rooms**. You can add/create tag while you are in process of creating new Room or add/crete tag to existing room directly in table.
