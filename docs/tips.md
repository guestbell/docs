# Tips

GuestBell allows your guests to tip your employees. You can enabled this feature in **Property -> Edit property** section **Features**. You can also configure this on per-employee basis via the **Employee details** page. You can find this in **Property -> Staff -> Details**.

This is how tipping looks like in the guest app.

Once a tip is placed, it will automatically be added the the guest check-in details. The tipped amount will be collected during check-out.

?> **Tip** You can link directly to a specific employee's tip page. Simply navigate to the page yourself in your app, then copy the url. In my example, the tip url is: *https://guest.guestbell.com/demo-hotel/app/my-profile/tipping/217*. You can easily convert this into a QR code and place it in such a way, so that guests can find it easily and tip your employee.
