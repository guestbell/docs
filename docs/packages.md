# Packages

It's is common in hospitality to sell services via packages. You can for instance have **Breakfast included**, **Half-board**, **Full-board** and **All inclusive**. GuestBell supports this via **Packages**. You can find them in **Property -> Services -> Packages**.

You can create a package on this page by clicking the create button.

1. _Title_ - Name of the package that will also be presented to the guest
2. _Visible in self check-in_ - Based on your configuration, guests might be able to self-check-in to your property. In such case, you can decide if you want to let them indicate which packages are included in their stay. Otherwise your staff would need to do this in the check-in details page. Check this checkbox to allow guest to add this package when they check-in
3. _On by default_ - Check this to force this package for every newly checked in guest.

Once created, you can choose if **service groups** or **items** are included or excluded in a given packages. To do this, navigate to **group** or **item details page** and locate the **Packages section**.

?> **Tip** Service items and groups included in packages will be hidden to guests who are not checked-in to GuestBell.
