?> **Tip:** You can send Group Message to all Guest by using top left checkbox to select all and then click **GROUP MESSAGE** Button. Otherwise you can select specific rooms by ticking checkbox next to room one by one.

Attending conversation with your guest couldn't be easier. We understand that time is precious and that's why we came up with the perfect chat solution. Multiple employee can attend the same chat but there is always one Main Agent chosen by the system. This person will be responsible to carry out the conversation. You will also see if there are other employees present. If Main Agent leaves conversation and there are no other employees attending chat, notification will re-appear for all employees.

We want to make sure every conversation with your guest is properly resolved. At the end of every chat you need to press **RESOLVED** Button in order to mute notification for this chat.
