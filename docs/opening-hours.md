# Opening hours

Opening hours serve multiple purposes in GuestBell. In it's simplest, it will allow your guests to see when your services are available. It will also allow you to configure services that are offered via time-spans such as massages or custom ranges such as renting sports equipment. You can also track usage and set limits by configuring maximum capacity.

You can find opening hours by navigating to **Property -> Services -> Opening hours**. This page holds a table of all opening hours as well as a button to create new ones. You will also find this button while creating new service items so that you don't always have to come to this page. Upon pressing it, the following modal appears.

## Creating opening hours

1. Start by choosing a title for your opening hours
2. Next comes the type. In GuestBell, we have 3 different types of opening hours. We will look at those in detail in following section
3. Opening hours section. Here you can either indicate that the opening hours are available 24/7, or configure times specifically for each day
4. Special opening hours allows you to override opening hours for specific dates such as bank holidays or special events like on the following image

## Opening hours section

Once you un-tick the "Open 24/7" checkbox, following section will appear

Start by clicking the "Add new time range" button. This will add 2 new fields for that day titled "Opens" and "Closes". Use the controls for these fields to customize opening hours. Remember that each day can have multiple time ranges. This is useful for configuring things like a split for a restaurant.

?> **Tip:** Did you notice the first day in the table is called "Standard day"? You can configure this day and then reuse it for days in the week by ticking the "Standard day?" checkbox. This way you don't have to repeat the same opening hours for the whole week if every day is the same. Also if you change the standard days, all days with "Standard day?" indicated will change as well.

## Opening hours type

Different opening hours types will help you to achieve different goals

- **Simple** - use this type when you simply want to indicate opening hours
- **Time span** - ideal for service items that require booking activities, for example excursions or massages. Generally speaking use this for service items that require predetermined amount of time
- **Time range** - use this for renting equipment or any other activity where the guest can decide how long they want to use it for

## Capacity

When configuring the type of the opening hours to be **Time span** or **Time range**, a new option called "Use capacity" will appear. Tick this and GuestBell will automatically track capacity for ordered items. Capacity in this context can mean a number of things. For example, places in a restaurant, number of bicycles to rent or number of spots in an excursion.

To indicate capacity when the "Open 24/7" checkbox is checked, a new field called default capacity will appear. Use this to configure the capacity for the whole week.

If the "Open 24/7" checkbox is unchecked, a new field called capacity will appear for each time range in every day like on the following picture.

When this is configured, you can find a breakdown of booked activities [here](schedules.md)
