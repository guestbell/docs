# Getting started with GuestBell

We've spent a lot of time making sure it's easy to create and configure your new hotel app. It only takes minutes to get the basic version online, and your app should be up and ready with full customization in a few hours max. We've prepared a number of ways to make this process smooth and enjoyable. Before we even jump to these, you might find it useful to first learn a bit about the [dashboard basics](overview.md).

# Interactive tutorials

There are a few key things every hotel owner needs to configure before they start using the app. We've made interactive tutorials for all of these, that means our dashboard will lead you through the whole process step-by-step. You can find them [here](https://dashboard.guestbell.com/getting-started).

# Learning center

GuestBell includes an integrated learning center. You can find it [here](https://dashboard.guestbell.com/learning-center). It contains various tips and tutorials that will help you configure your hotel.

# Integrated documentation

We try to include help across the dashboard, in every place where it might be beneficial. When on a page, keep an eye out for a question mark icon in the top right corner.

Once you click it, documentation sidebar will appear. In there, you will find complete help, along with some useful buttons. You can use these buttons to open a full version of the docs, interactive tutorial or the learning center.

While in dashboard, you will also find many smaller question mark icons. Hovering over these will trigger an informational tooltip.
