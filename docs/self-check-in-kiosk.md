# Self check-in kiosk

?> **Tip** Self check-in kiosk is only applicable if you have enabled self check-in functionality. You can find out more in [check-ins documentation](checkins.md?id=self-check-in)

Self check-in kiosk is a great way to interactively onboard guests to your app. Here is how it works:

1. Navigate to **SC Kiosk** from the sidebar
2. You can click full-screen button to enter a full screen view
3. Present this page to your guests, ideally on a dedicated tablet, laptop or a touch screen
4. Guests can then click the button shown bellow to obtain their unique QR code used to access the app

?> **Tip** Kiosk will automatically generate [self check-in QR codes](self-check-in-code.md) if these are enabled

## Account recommendations

We highly recommend to create a dedicated account and employee (this is GuestBell jargon, it's not an actual person) for your check-in kiosk. The employee assigned to the kiosk should only have GET and POST permissions for Check-in. This kiosk will likely end up displayed somewhere without 100% supervision, therefore it's best to keep things safe and only allow it to do the bare minimum. Find out how to [create employee](staff.md) and [configure permissions](permissions.md) by following these links.

?> **Tip** You can create a new account by going to https://auth.guestbell.com. Click **Sign Out** (if you are currently signed in), then **sign up** with a new account. We recommend to create a dedicated email address for this account.
