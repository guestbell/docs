# Plan

Creating Property in GuestBell is a 2 Step Process. First you Create Plan, then you add your property. Go to **My Plans** in the Side Bar Menu. Here you can see all of your existing plans and properties assigned to them. One GuestBell account can have multiple plans with different properties.

We can see how it looks when we have plan with assigned property and plan with no property. Plan with no property include **Create Property** Button. **Learn more about [Property](property.md).** Otherwise every plan has **Details, Modify, Options** Button. In Options there is **Create Property, Delete Plan, Delete Property**.

## Create Plan

Start creating Plan by Clicking **ADD NEW PLAN** and filling up details in Modal. Then you just go to Payment information and you are ready to go.

## Modify Plan

At any time of your subscription you downgrade/upgrade your plan. Changes will affect your Billing from the moment you modify your plan. If you downgrade your plan we will calculate outstanding amount and add this credit to your account. This credit will then by used to pay for your next month/year.  If you upgrade we will send you invoice for new amount by calculating difference between plans.
