Content Manager will show you all missing translations as the one you already made. When you successfully translate your content tick the box under translation **Is Verified** and Save Changes. In some cases you can decide to use default language for new translation, then tick the box **Use Default** and don't forget to verify.

?> **Tip** You can view your content in GuestBell Dashboard (Homepage and Services) in a different language by changing settings in Language Options.

We also provide option to create translation while you create/edit Services. Language Icon is conveniently present in **Create Service Modal** or in **Service Details**. This will give you option to create translation as you go.
