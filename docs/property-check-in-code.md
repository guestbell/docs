# Property check-in code

Congratulations! Your app is visible online now that you enabled *Public page* in [edit property](property.md). That's great as it allows guests to easily access your hotel app via URL on any device. However, if you allow guests to [self check-in](checkins.md?id=self-check-in) without restrictions, you might inadvertently allow unauthorized check-ins by anyone who finds your app online. To mitigate this risk, we have implemented various security measures, including the use of a **Property check-in code**.

This code, consisting of six letters or numbers, acts as an added layer of security during the check-in process. Guests are required to enter this code to check in, ensuring that only authorized individuals are able to place orders or send messages.

## Setup

You can setup **Property check-in code** by navigating to **Property -> Edit property** in the sidebar, and opening the **Self check-in** section. Note that you will need to enable [Expert mode](overview.md?id=advanced-features) to see this section.

## Improving user experience

While the use of a property check-in code adds a valuable layer of security, it can also be cumbersome for guests who have to type it in manually. To streamline this process, we offer the use of **Deep links**, which allow you to embed the property check-in code directly in the URL.

1. Navigate to **Property -> Deep links**
2. Open the **Self check-in information** section
3. Click the **Reveal** button next to **Property check-in code** field
4. Now you can copy the URL bellow that already contains the code. Anybody who opens this url will have the code prefill once they order or message.

By utilizing this feature, you can improve your guests' experience while ensuring the security of your property.
